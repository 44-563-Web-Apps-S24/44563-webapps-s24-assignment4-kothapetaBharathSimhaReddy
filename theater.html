    <h2>The three sisters act 3 by Anton Chekov</h2>

    <p>NATASHA. What are you doing, Andrey? Are you reading? It's nothing, only
        I.... [She opens another door, and looks in, then closes it] Isn't there
        any fire....</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Enters with book in hand] What are you doing, Natasha?</p>

    <p>NATASHA. I was looking to see if there wasn't a fire. It's Shrovetide,
        and the servant is simply beside herself; I must look out that something
        doesn't happen. When I came through the dining-room yesterday midnight,
        there was a candle burning. I couldn't get her to tell me who had
        lighted it. [Puts down her candle] What's the time?</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Looks at his watch] A quarter past eight.</p> 
    
    <p>NATASHA. And Olga and Irina aren't in yet. The poor things are still at
        work. Olga at the teacher's council, Irina at the telegraph office....
        [Sighs] I said to your sister this morning, "Irina, darling, you must
        take care of yourself." But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a
        quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so
        cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so
        frightened!</p>
    
    <p>ANDREY. It's all right, Natasha. The boy is well.</p>
    
    <p>NATASHA. Still, I think we ought to put him on a diet. I am so afraid.
        And the entertainers were to be here after nine; they had better not
        come, Audrey.</p>
