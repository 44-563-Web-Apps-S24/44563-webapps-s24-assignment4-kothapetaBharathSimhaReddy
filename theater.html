    <h2>The three sisters act 3 by Anton Chekov</h2>

    <p>NATASHA. What are you doing, Andrey? Are you reading? It's nothing, only
        I.... [She opens another door, and looks in, then closes it] Isn't there
        any fire....</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Enters with book in hand] What are you doing, Natasha?</p>

    <p>NATASHA. I was looking to see if there wasn't a fire. It's Shrovetide,
        and the servant is simply beside herself; I must look out that something
        doesn't happen. When I came through the dining-room yesterday midnight,
        there was a candle burning. I couldn't get her to tell me who had
        lighted it. [Puts down her candle] What's the time?</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Looks at his watch] A quarter past eight.</p> 
    
    <p>NATASHA. And Olga and Irina aren't in yet. The poor things are still at
        work. Olga at the teacher's council, Irina at the telegraph office....
        [Sighs] I said to your sister this morning, "Irina, darling, you must
        take care of yourself." But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a
        quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so
        cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so
        frightened!</p>
    
    <p>ANDREY. It's all right, Natasha. The boy is well.</p>
    
    <p>NATASHA. Still, I think we ought to put him on a diet. I am so afraid.
        And the entertainers were to be here after nine; they had better not
        come, Audrey.</p>
     
    <p>ANDREY. I don't know. After all, they were asked.</p>

    <p>NATASHA. This morning, when the little boy woke up and saw me he
        suddenly smiled; that means he knew me. "Good morning, Bobby!" I said,
        "good morning, darling." And he laughed. Children understand, they
        understand very well. So I'll tell them, Andrey dear, not to receive the
        entertainers. </p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Hesitatingly] But what about my sisters. This is their flat.</p>

    <p>NATASHA. They'll do as I want them. They are so kind.... [Going] I
        ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk
        and nothing else, or you won't get thin. [Stops] Bobby is so cold. I'm
        afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into
        another room till the warm weather comes. Irina's room, for instance,
        is just right for a child: it's dry and has the sun all day. I must tell
        her, she can share Olga's room. It isn't as if she was at home in the
        daytime, she only sleeps here.... [A pause] Andrey, darling, why are you
        so silent?</p>

    <p> ANDREY. I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say....</p>

    <p>NATASHA. Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.
        Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Yawns] Call him here. </p>

    <p> [NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she
        has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the
        collar up. His ears are muffled.] </p>

    <p>ANDREY. Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say? </p>

    <p>FERAPONT. The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.
        Here.... [Hands him a book and a packet.] </p>

    <p>ANDREY. Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
        past eight now. </p>

    <p>FERAPONT. What?</p>

    <p>ANDREY. [Louder]. I say you've come late, it's past eight. </p>

    <p>FERAPONT. Yes, yes. I came when it was still light, but they wouldn't
        let me in. They said you were busy. Well, what was I to do. If you're
        busy, you're busy, and I'm in no hurry. [He thinks that ANDREY is asking
        him something] What? </p>
