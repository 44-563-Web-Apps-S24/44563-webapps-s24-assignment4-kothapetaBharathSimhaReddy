    <h2>The Three Sisters Act 3 by Anton Chekov</h2>

<h5> ANDREY</h5>
<p>[Hesitatingly]</p>
<p>But what about my sisters. This is their flat.</p>

<h5>NATASHA</h5> 
<p>They'll do as I want them. They are so kind.... </p>
<p>[Going] </p>
<p>I ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk and nothing else, or you won't get thin.</p>
<p>[Stops]</p>
<p>Bobby is so cold. I'm afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into another room till the warm weather comes. Irina's room, for instance,is just right for a child: it's dry and has the sun all day. I must tell her, she can share Olga's room. It isn't as if she was at home in the daytime, she only sleeps here.... </p>
<p>[A pause]</p>
<p>Andrey, darling, why are you so silent?</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5>
<p>I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say....</p>

<h5>NATASHA</h5>
<p>Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5>
 <p>[Yawns]</p>
 <p>Call him here.</p>


<p>[NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she
    has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the
    collar up. His ears are muffled.]</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5>
<p>Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say?</p>

<h5>FERAPONT</h5>
<p>The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.</p>
<p>Here....</p>
<p>[Hands him a book and a packet.]</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5>
<p>Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
    past eight now.</p>

<h5>FERAPONT</h5>
<p> What?</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5> 
<p>[Louder]</p>
<p>I say you've come late, it's past eight.</p>

<h5>FERAPONT</h5>
<p>Yes, yes. I came when it was still light, but they wouldn't
    let me in. They said you were busy. Well, what was I to do. If you're
    busy, you're busy, and I'm in no hurry.</p>
<p>[He thinks that ANDREY is asking
    him something]</p>
<p> What?</p>


<h5>ANDREY</h5>
<p>If you weren't, I don't suppose I should talk to you. I've got
    to talk to somebody, and my wife doesn't understand me, and I'm a bit
    afraid of my sisters--I don't know why unless it is that they may
    make fun of me and make me feel ashamed... I don't drink, I don't like
    public-houses, but how I should like to be sitting just now in Tyestov's
    place in Moscow, or at the Great Moscow, old fellow!</p>

<h5>FERAPONT</h5>
<p>Moscow? That's where a contractor was once telling that some merchants or other were eating pancakes; one ate forty pancakes and he went and died, he was saying. Either forty or fifty, I forget which.</p>

<h5>ANDREY</h5>
<p>In Moscow you can sit in an enormous restaurant where you don't know anybody and where nobody knows you, and you don't feel all the samethat you're a stranger. And here you know everybody and everybody knows you, and you're a stranger... and a lonely stranger.</p>

<h5>FERAPONT</h5>
<p>What? And the same contractor was telling--perhaps he was lying--that there was a cable stretching right across Moscow.</p>
